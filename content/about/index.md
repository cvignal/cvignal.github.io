Hello, I am Charles and I am a Software Engineer working in Paris! I'm currently working at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) within the Alerting platform where I'm in charge of increasing the reliability of our monitor evaluations!

I previously worked on the internal data platform used by data scientists at [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com) and on the Warehouse Management System developped by [KBRW](https://kbrw.com).

After these experiences, I would define myself as language agnostic with some preferences, having developped professionally in Elixir, Python, Golang, Rust... I try to concern myself with maintable and scalable systems, for humans and machines.
