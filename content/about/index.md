Hello, I am Charles and I am a Software Engineer working in Paris! I'm currently working at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) within the Alerting group where I'm charge of increasing the reliability of our alerting system!

I previously worked on the internal data platform used by data scientists at [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com) and on the Warehouse Management System developped by [KBRW](https://kbrw.com).

I would say I'm language agnostic, having developped professionally in Elixir, Python, Golang, Rust... I'm mostly concerned about good design and pragmastism regarding tool choice!
